# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis in Excel

Maven Analytics has already cleaned and made the fictional Coffee Shop Sales data in three different locations in NYU available to the public. 

To better understand purchase behavior and streamline operations, I collected transactional data from Jan-Jun 2023. The goal is to transform the data into a dynamic dashboard that Frenchie owner can used to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for business.

Excel Tools: Pivot Table, Pivot Chart, VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, VBA

Download Dataset: 

### In this Excel interactive dashboard, I focused on answering/providing insights into the following questions from the data:
1. How have Maven Roasters sales trended over time?
2. Which days of the week are busiest?
3. Which products are sold most and least often? Which drives the most revenue for the business?

## Process

1. Prepare the raw data for analysis
2. Explore the data with Excel Pivot Tables
3. Build a Dynamic Dashboard to visualize patterns and trends
